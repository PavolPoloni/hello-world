# hello-world
My first repositary
My name is Pavol Polóni. I am thirty-six years old and I come from Banská Bystrica. I have studied at Banking Institute College of Prague in Banská Bystrica Information Technologies where I finished with bachelor's degree. Next I continued in master's degree in Information Technologies and Management that I didn't finish because of taking away of accreditation so at the moment I am only bachelor. Nowadays I am employeed at SPOSA BB. I take care for handicap people with autism and at the same I am doing administration and accounting works. In my leisure time I learn programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, SQL and foreign languages English and German. In summer I like swimming, cycling and hiking.
